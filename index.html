      <p>Hello. I have studied computer science for A levels using python, but wasn't really good at programming. The 2020 coding bootcamp helped tremendously
	with my programming skills.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020:Bouncing game</h3>
    <p>
	This is the game that I have created for the past few days. Oringally, I had planned to create a brick breaker type of game, however the collison between the bricks and the ball were extreamly buggy so I had to change it from brick breaker to a bouncing game. The input keys to move the keys are 'a' to move left and 'd' to move right. If any other button is pressed, it will allow the game to be paused. Once the ball hits the bottom of the screen, a game over text will appear, which you can press Space-bar to continue playing.
